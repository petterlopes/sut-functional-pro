# openapi-fetch + Next.js

Example of using openapi-fetch in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using server-rendered data.

For an example of fetching clientside, see the [React Query example](../react-query) which also works in Next.js (React Query is recommended over SWR because of type inference).

## Setup

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

Youâ€™ll see the server running at `localhost:3000`
